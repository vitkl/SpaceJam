# Notebooks

#### 1_A1_v2_pyramid_slide_extractor.ipynb :: 
- Enables to parsing of pyramidal images in python, resizing and generation of plotly elements to be placed into "template/wc_selector/categories/"

#### 2_A1_V1_ROI_image_downsampler.ipynb ::
- ROI image resizing and thumbail generation and organisation of ROI files to be placed in "template/DR_plots/categories"

#### 3 :: A2_V4_GSEA_cluster_summaries_from_DE_cytoscape.ipynb::
- A notebook written in R which outputs an interactive viewer for enriched geneset markov clusters and their associated functional annotations.
This tool utlises cytoscape.js as a viewer and users can either use a template cytoscape.js or directly export their graphs in cytoscape as "webpage". This tool uses readily available tools to retrieve enriched genesets from the DE output for each comparator category. The GSEA output is then clustered by a graph dervied from a geneset similarity matrix and a simple annotation is made from semantic summarisation by frequency of tokenized terms. This tool requires cytoscape to function.
