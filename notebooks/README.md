#### 07 A2_V4_GSEA_cluster_summaries_from_DE_cytoscape.ipynb::
- A notebook written in R which utlises readily available tools to retrieve enriched genesets from the DE output for each comparator category. The GSEA output is then clustered by a graph dervied from a geneset similarity matrix and a simple annotation is made from semantic summarisation by frequency of tokenized terms. This tool requires cytoscape to function.
